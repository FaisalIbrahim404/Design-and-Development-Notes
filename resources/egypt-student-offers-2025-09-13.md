#### Eligibility Checklist (prepare these)
- Student ID card (with photo), current semester enrollment letter, or tuition receipt.  
- National ID/passport (for identity matching).  
- Screenshots/links to your university profile page showing enrollment.  
- ISIC (if you have it) as alternative verification for some services.  
- Personal email + phone number; GitHub account.  
- Optional: Faculty advisor contact (for programs that ask).  
- Credit card only when explicitly required (e.g., Oracle Cloud free tier).

#### No student email? How to proceed
- GitHub Student Pack: Apply with your personal email and upload student ID/enrollment proof; GitHub’s manual review often accepts this.  
- JetBrains Education: Use document verification instead of .edu email.  
- Coursera: Use Financial Aid (no student email needed).  
- Figma/Notion/Miro: Many education programs allow document upload if your university domain isn’t recognized—submit student ID + enrollment letter.  
- If a provider requires SheerID/UNiDAYS and your university isn’t in their database, contact their support with scanned proof, or use the GitHub Pack’s partner route when available.

#### Important Egypt-specific note
- Time-limited: Google Gemini Pro complimentary 12-month plan for students in Egypt; register before Nov 3, 2025.  
- Some global vendors rely on automated student verification systems; if your .edu.eg domain isn’t recognized, manual proof usually works via uploads or the GitHub Pack partner links.  
- Credit-card-free: Prefer GitHub Pack, Azure for Students, AWS Educate, Vercel/Netlify, MongoDB Atlas M0, Colab, Kaggle, Hugging Face.
